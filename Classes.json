- - - ( Classes ) - - -


- The purpose of Classes is to encapsulate data & acts as blueprint


1) ( "PHP Properties" ):

- {Private}:
   the only class that has access to the "private variable",
   is the class where the "private variable" is declared


- {Protected}:
  any class that isn't a "child class" of a class 
  where a "protected variable" is declared, 
  has no access to that "protected variable"
  ( nearly the same as private )


- {Public}: everyone has access to the "public variable"




2) ( "PHP Constructor" ):

- {Constructor}: 
  a "method / function" inside a "class", that is automatically 
  "executed", when an "object (instance of the class)" is "created"

  basically "assigns data" to the "variables ( which currently 
  has no data )" within the "class"


- ( Example ):

  // Your Variables
  private $brand;
  private $color;

  // Your Constructor 
  *private/public/protected function __construct( *value1, *value2 ){
  $this -> brand = $value1;
  $this -> color = $value2;
  }

  // Your Instance
  $Var_Instance = new *Your_Class( *Pass_Value#1, *Pass_Value#2 );




3) ( "Constructor Property Promotion "):

- a feature that lets you "declare & initialize" "class properties",
  directly in the "constructor parameters", 
  
  while "normal class properties" are "declared" "outside" the "constructor",
  they can be "initialized" in the "constructor body( {} )" or "Later"



- ( Example ):

class User {
    // Normal class property (non-promoted property)
    public string $role; 

    // Promoted properties
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public int $age
    ) {
        // Initialize non-promoted properties here
        $this->role = "guest";
    }
}
 
  


4) ( "PHP Accessing Variables & Method ( If Allowed/Public )" ):

- ( Example(1) ):

  // Class Variables
  public $brand = volvo;
  public $color = red;

  // Access Variables
  echo "*Instance -> *Present_Class_Variable;";

  
- ( Example(2) ):

  // Access Variables within a Class, with a Method 
  *private/public/protected function *Method_Name(){
   return $this->brand . $this->color
  }

  // Accessing the Method in the Class ( Must be Public )
   echo *Instance -> *Method_Name();

   or  *Instance -> *Method_Name();// A Standalone Executable




5) ( "PHP Getter & Setter Methods" ):


- ( Getter Method, Returns values of a Class ):
  
 *private/public/protected function *getMethod(){ 
 return $this -> *Present_Variable; 
 }


- ( Setter Method, Sets values of a Class ):

 *private/public/protected function *setMethod( *value1, *value2 ){ 
 $this -> *Present_Variable1 = *Value1;
 $this -> *Present_Variable2 = *Value2;
 }
